# CraftBeerPi4 Plugin to create Beer.XML, KBHv2 and Brewfather App recipes

## Currently, the latest cbpi4 and cbpi4ui forks  from my GIT repo are required. 

## This plugin is an example on how to create recipes. It basically has the same functionality as the included recipe creation but can be modified to the user requirements.

- Beer.xml file or kbh database needs to be uploaded via user interface
- BF recipe can be accessed directly via user interface (paid BF account required)
- Please check also cbpi4 Settings as several parameters will be added by this plugin.
	- If you want to use this plugin instead of the native recipe creation capabilities, you need to change the settings parameter 'RECIPE_CREATION_PATH' to 'creation'
- No other changes are required.
- This allows the user to modify the plugin to his needs and to combine steps as required for his equipment. 
- No change of cbpi4 is required


- Changelog:

** 12.07.21:
	- New version that can be used with the native upload capabilities of my fork

** 24.03.21:
	- Initial release
